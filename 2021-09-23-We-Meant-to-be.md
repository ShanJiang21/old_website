明明没有在一起就好像失恋了一样,



From my perspective, Clicking with somebody does not happen very fast. 

I was just speaking up the things that make me feel uncomfortable with, instead of being politely and playing nice, I am doing a good practice by setting a healthy boundary between the dubious boy and me. 

I am taking back the control and the right to write the story of my own, no matter it is a period or an exclamation mark, the ending does come. 

> The wound is where light enters you.  -- Rumi

There are a series of struggles and traumas 

Develop a better skill of pain tolerance. 

Question 1: What sticks in my mind? 

> Forgiveness is letting go of the hope that the past will be different.

After learning to let it go, knowing that you have no power to change the past, I shall be free. 



Flip into the positive side 

真正的离别，关门声最小. 

甭提什么合理不合理的了。

闭上眼睛过日子，受气什么的都是小事。

**自我约束太紧**

程衍樑在他的播客里边说：曾经也有一段时间，因为身边两位采访者的去世，有些轻微抑郁，夜晚插着耳机，在桂林路-田林路的路上晃悠。

同款焦虑、失眠和自我约束，常常想归隐自然，强烈的想要逃离这份工作。

但还得吃饭。

作为一个工人，我这一年进步了；

作为一个人，我是堕落了。

新的一岁，我要做一个勇猛精进的生活着的人，YOLO。
