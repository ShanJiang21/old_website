明明没有在一起就好像失恋了一样,



From my perspective, Clicking with somebody does not happen very fast.

I was just speaking up the things that make me feel uncomfortable with, instead of being politely and playing nice, I am doing a good practice by setting a healthy boundary between the dubious boy and me.

I am taking back the control and the right to write the story of my own, no matter it is a period or an exclamation mark, the ending does come.

There are a series of struggles and traumas

Develop a better skill of pain tolerance.

Question 1: What sticks in my mind?

> Forgiveness is letting go of the hope that the past will be different.

After learning to let it go, knowing that you have no power to change the past, I shall be free.



Flip into the positive side

真正的离别，关门声最小.

甭提什么合理不合理的了。

闭上眼睛过日子，受气什么的都是小事。

东兔西乌：古代神话传说中说，月亮里有玉兔，太阳里有三足金乌，所以用乌、兔代表日月。月亮东升，太阳西落。表示时光不断流逝。

**自我约束太紧**

程衍樑在他的播客里边说：曾经也有一段时间，因为身边两位采访者的去世，有些轻微抑郁，夜晚插着耳机，在桂林路-田林路的路上晃悠。

同款焦虑、失眠和自我约束，常常想归隐自然，强烈的想要逃离这份工作。

但还得吃饭。

作为一个工人，我这一年进步了；

作为一个人，我是堕落了。

新的一岁，我要做一个勇猛精进的生活着的人，YOLO。




Instead of finishing the tasks being assigned, being engaged actually means I care about my work and the company I am working for -- ByteDance. A huge commitment does come in multiple sources: discretionary efforts are paid for promoting the projects, launching the new features, and reducing communication costs. Here I listed my observations of my own from three perspectives:

- Intellectual Commitment: Competitor analysis, interpretation of engagement and safety metrics in different views, negotiations with  OPS, TikTok-Data and all stakeholders, Compliance requests and

- Physical Commitment: Unpaid Overtime working and invisible time devotion in the early morning and late nights, which led to mental exhaustion caused by excessive and prolonged stress. Reasonable OT is fine, but an alway-on lifestyle is not right, even though we do live in an always-on world.

- Emotional Commitment: Feeling upset and frustrated is quite common here in TNS and the self-harm images/videos do hurt our feelings as human beings. We all get upset from time to time, but if the team can provide more resources and be more supportive, I believe my emotional commitment is huge in the past half-year, I believe in the worth and credibility of the organization, but I think it can be improved.

Not everything that can be counted counts and not everything that counts can be counted, said Albert Einstein. Luckily, I am allowed to live my value of Integrity, honesty and rigour in this organization.

Hopefully, I can grow here to be a better person. I am here not only working for money but for a better community that we can build for the whole world.

只有经济学中的绝对理性人，才会只为钱财卖命。

但在字节的TNS这个平台，我之所以愿意投入大量的精力和时间反复讨论，验证指标，推进项目，是因为现在我对自己的定位是“内容医生”，我们为内容安全和质量负责，每天都在从各个维度思考，从设计产品策略入手，保证平台生态的平衡，始终坚持对于高质量和创意内容的保护，作为内容安全产品，我的主要投入集中在以下三个方面：

- 【智识投入】对于线上问题的认知到位，风险意识较强，对于线上现存的风险识别，定位，处理和风险控制构建起了一套认知/落地的框架和流程。第一时间对于线上的舆情风险进行模型侧落地和反馈，即使给予有效的解决方案。
- 【情感参与 & 身体支持】 为了适应公司的多元文化和国际化环境，长期隐形加班：坚持早会 + 经常熬夜，直接引发了饮食不规律，睡眠失调和焦虑. 「力微任重久神疲，再竭衰庸定不支」, 非常希望团队之后能够建立起比较完善的培训体系，能够让新人尽快上手，保证大家的身心健康。
