# Shan's personal website

This is Shan's personal website for displaying projects and blog posts, welcome to share your ideas with me.The theme is forked from [Vno Jekyll](https://github.com/onevcat/vno-jekyll), you can also choose an easier Wordpress or Hexo support for hosting your blog, so that you can avoid from the annoying debugging process.
