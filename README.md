# Shan's personal website

This is Shan's personal website for displaying projects and blog posts, welcome to share your ideas with me.The theme is forked from [Vno Jekyll](https://github.com/onevcat/vno-jekyll),you can also choose a easier wordpress or github support for hosting your blog, but the thing is that sometimes the debugging process is annoying.

### Remain unsolved 
- Support for bilingual settings; 
- Easier ways to support the math equations; 
- Markdown Post header problem.
- Image organization; 

#### For Fun

This website also support for [996 vs ICU project](https://github.com/996icu/996.ICU/tree/master/blacklist) as I believe all lives matter.
