In 2020, I graduated from Mailman school of Public Health, Columbia University. Currently, I am working for [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/) as a product specialist, however, this occupational identity is merely a tiny facet of me:
* **Biological Structure:** A five-foot-six girl (she/her/hers).
* **Social identity**: a daughter, runner and an annoying reader who gives harsh comments.
* **A Critical Don Quixote**: An Anti-social tomboy.

As a degreed sociology lover, I know it is critical to breathe and desire and it's okay to go over the top.

In my spare time, I enjoy coffee beans, kebabs, mixed with running along the Hudson River in Upper Westside, and it is usually nice to talk with my friends in some tiny but cozy spot hidden in the huge city.
