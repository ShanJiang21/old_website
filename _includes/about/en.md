I am  *@Shan Jiang*(<span lang="zh">姜珊</span>), now a master student at the Department of biostatistics, from [Columbia University](https://www.mailman.columbia.edu/become-student/departments/biostatistics).

I am working on developing an Energy Insecurity Instrument. My research interests fall into computational social science and network analysis, health and loneliness, media censorship. Prior to my graduate school studies, I received my B.A. at [Central University of Finance and Economics](http://en.cufe.edu.cn/), China.

This website contains several main sections including my projects, my comments on classical sociological papers, statistical resources, and some tutorials for data visualization in R.

In my spare time, I prefer to do some running along the Hudson River and have a nice talk with my friends in some tiny spot in the New York City.
