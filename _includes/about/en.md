I am  *@Shan*(<span lang="zh">姜珊</span>), now a pre-final year master student at the Department of biostatistics, from [Columbia University](https://www.mailman.columbia.edu/become-student/departments/biostatistics).

I am working on two projects, first, I am actively working on a text-mining based media bias detection project under the supervision of Dr.Lu at Columbia Sociology, to map the news coverage patterns for social protests in China. In particular, my work focuses on retrieving the features of protest issues from social media for developing a model for predicting what factors are significant for media coverage of protest under the contemporary  Chinese political climate.Besides, I have been developing an Energy Insecurity Instrument in my collaboration with Prof. Hernandéz. My research interests fall into computational social science and network analysis, health and loneliness, and media censorship.

Prior to my graduate school studies, I received my B.A. at [Central University of Finance and Economics](http://en.cufe.edu.cn/), China, where I grew up.

This website contains several main sections including my projects, my comments on classical sociological papers, statistical resources, and some tutorials for data visualization in R.

In my spare time, I am enjoying coffee beans, kebabs, mixed with little bit running along the Hudson River in Upper West side, and it is usually nice to talk with my friends in some tiny but interesting spot in the huge NYC.

hope you can share some of your thoughts with me if you'd like.
