Hi, I am Shan, a [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/) product specialist and a degreed sociology lover.

* **Biological Structure:** A five-foot-six girl (she/her/hers).

* **Social identity**: a daughter, runner and an annoying reader who gives harsh comments.

In my spare time, I enjoy coffee beans, kebabs, mixed with running along the Hudson River in Upper Westside, and it is usually nice to talk with my friends in some tiny but cozy spot hidden in the huge city.
