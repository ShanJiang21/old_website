I am  *@Shan* (<span lang="zh">姜珊</span>), recently graduated from the department of biostatistics, [Columbia University](https://www.mailman.columbia.edu/become-student/departments/biostatistics). Now I am working as a junior strategy analyst for Tik Tok, based in Beijing Office.

Prior to my graduate school studies, I received my B.A. at [Central University of Finance and Economics](http://en.cufe.edu.cn/), China, where I grew up.

This website contains several main sections including my projects, my comments on classical sociological papers, statistical resources, and some tutorials for data visualization in R.

In my spare time, I am enjoying coffee beans, kebabs, mixed with little bit running along the Hudson River in Upper West side, and it is usually nice to talk with my friends in some tiny but interesting spot in the huge NYC.
