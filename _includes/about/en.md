#### About me

In 2020, I graduated from Mailman school of Public Health, Columbia University. During 2020-2022, I worked in [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/) as a rookie product manager, after being locked down in Shanghai for 2 months, I decided to seek a new place to continue my professional life. After moving to Singapore, I worked in Shopee for 15 months until Oct 2023, focused on recommendation strategy design for cross-border e-commerce business.  

Currently, I am enjoying my career break. If you think I am a good fit, please hit my [curriculum vitae](./Shan_CV_2023.pdf).

However, I do believe the occupational identity is merely a tiny facet of me:
* **Biological Structure:** A five-foot-six girl (she/her/hers).
* **Social identity**: a daughter, runner and an annoying reader who gives harsh comments.
* **A Critical Don Quixote**: An Anti-social tomboy.
