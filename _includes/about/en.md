Hi, I am Shan, now I am working in [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/) as a product specialist, however, this occupational identity is just a tiny facet of me. I am also a degreed sociology lover.

* **Biological Structure:** A five-foot-six girl (she/her/hers).
* **Social identity**: a daughter, runner and an annoying reader who gives harsh comments.
* **A Critical Don Quixote**: An Anti-social tomboy.

In my spare time, I enjoy coffee beans, kebabs, mixed with running along the Hudson River in Upper Westside, and it is usually nice to talk with my friends in some tiny but cozy spot hidden in the huge city.
