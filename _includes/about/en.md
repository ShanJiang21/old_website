### About me

In 2020, I graduated from Mailman school of Public Health, Columbia University. During 2020-2022, I worked in [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/) as a rookie product manager, after being locked down in Shanghai for 2 months, I decided to seek a new place to continue my professional life.

Currently, I am working in Shopee as a PM, focused on recommendation strategy design, if you think I am a good fit, please hit my [curriculum vitae](./shan_cv_2023.pdf).

However, I do believe the occupational identity is merely a tiny facet of me:
* **Biological Structure:** A five-foot-six girl (she/her/hers).
* **Social identity**: a daughter, runner and an annoying reader who gives harsh comments.
* **A Critical Don Quixote**: An Anti-social tomboy.

In my spare time, I enjoy coffee beans, kebabs, mixed with running along the Hudson River in Upper Westside, and it is usually nice to talk with my friends in some tiny but cozy spot hidden in the huge city.
