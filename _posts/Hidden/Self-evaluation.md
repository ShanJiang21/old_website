1. [POLICY LANDING IN MODEL]Profanity Policy model landing and localization: Build strategic relationships with global and cross-functional Policy partners to drive improvements to the content classification framework; provided robust evaluation AND model landing strategy design on back-end, re-structured the data stroage and promoted the successful integration of the strategy with current moderation pipeline.（w/: Tracy Elizabeth）

2. [DATA DRIVEN PRODUCTIZATION]Coordinated the set-up of A/B experiment design，confirmed the core performance metrics for the strategy and impact of the whole product：In total, we conducted 4 phases of A/B testing on FYF page for validating the potential effect on user engagement and retention over more than 5 months。（**w/:** Sitong Yang)

3. [COORDINATION XFN TEAMS]Cementing the connections of recommendation-side engineers, PMs and TNS-side PMs, identified the launch criteria and road-blockers. 

4. [SOFT LAUNCH IN EU/SEA/EN-MAIN COUNTRIES] Finally promoted the successful launch of profanity filter on TikTok For You Feed Page(Main mode) in 31 markets that cover European, South East Asia, United States, Australia, Ireland and United Kingdom. It is monitored on production end  6.08% videos are labelled by this strategy and around 7.98% videos are filtered on consumption end. Luckily there is no significant negative impact observed on engagemnt and retention metrics meanwhile.（w/: Tracy Elizabeth & Steve Pin & Sitong Yang ）

5. [CV MODEL due diligence check] On Model side, carried out the due diligence check of existing CV models and proactively explored the drinking, smoking and drugging models for mitigating susbstance abuse risks, prepared the model performance metrics, sampled cases and labelling policy for a realignment that can cater to Content Classification design on For You Feed page. 

6. Consulted with UR team to develop a questionnaire for informing the decision-making process on whether to make the maturity tagging mandate or optional for users and evalute the expectation of users on the product strategy. 

7. Helped the early research and validation form Push-PMs for profanity strategy. 

   

#### SDS Platform Construction  

1. 【Platform Productization】Setting the product vision and initiate the roadmap for similarity matching model services and banks. Navigating the milestones for projects and carry out the project management for an agile development.
2. 【Integrating business needs with Platform development】Collecting user stories, and expanding lines of business, Realizing an efficient and flexible configuration of different business lines, including user profile, short-videos, livestream and audio moderation process.
3. 【Fundamental Services design】Played a dominant role for prototype and feature design:
   1. Build a retracing and retroaction tab for providing an enhanced capability of identifying risks in historical posts, which is a strong booster for reacting to incidents/crisis management.
   2. Compiled a general cross-functional support for hashing value storage and matching: including NCMEC NGO and Industry database construction, KCC illegal recordings matching and so on. 
4. 【Operational functions landing】New feature release: Catalogued content management, seed content search and tracking, early earning and data monitoring, seed content life cycle management, permission control and clipping tools development. 

#### High-risk Deduplication video model and workflow Optimization 

1. 【Enhance high-risk deduplication ML video model】Keeping a close coorpertion with AI-Lab, carried out the optimization of video models in short-video business line. Promoted the full-launch of novel high-risk deduplication video model in July, enabling the violation rate lifted from 24% to around 36.71%.

2. 【Buidling up the training dataset for video high-risk deduplication ML video model】Leading the build-up for building the training dataset for high-risk deduplication ML video model, and constructed a stable labelling workflow, increased the recall for commonly-seen badcases. 

3. 【Revamping for incident labelling workflow】Mapping the incident labelling policy with 4.0 video moderation policy, and signed it off globally. RE-Defining the sources of incident labelling cases, revamping the labelling and clipping template, and configuring a new PMS template.

4. 【Localized deduplication model build-up】Completed the compliance review and set-up of localized dedeplication model and banks, setting the clipping SOP and launched the model in 4 countries. Provided effective support for tackling frame in frame issues in video moderation pipeline.  

   

#### Pakistan project 

1. Added a shunting button for moderation template for round-2 video moderation queues, reduced the leakages induced by language challenges, the precision is 92%.
2. Brought the Pakistan Urdu model for audio moderation pipeline with full traffic, uplifting the violation rate from 2% to 15%.(With Wenchao Zheng)
3. Conducted due diligence check on text-based model for language shunting via characters identified in video frames with AI-Lab : we examined the alphabet table and researched the local linguistic environment. (With Chen Zhu)



#### Audio Model Optimization 

1. Promoted the high-risk deduplication audio model to launch with 100% traffic. Added voice activity detection strategy for this model, which reduced the inefficient 8,700 enqueued cases and increased the violation rate from 0.56% to 3.42%.(with Zhu Bilei & Mingyu Liu)
2. Researched the available language shunting models across ByteDance and documented the conclusion for knowleage transfer for Issue-PNPs. 
3. Raised the Lanuage Identification Model(LID) model training request to AI-Lab acoustic team and prepared the training dataset in the format of audio clips, making it a great support for Pakistan and Turkish by the end of August. 
4. Launched the ASR-EN model globally for removing ANSA-spam related audios, build up the whole word corpus and evaluated the impact of sensitive keywords. (With Wenchao Zheng）
5. Established an auto-removal strategy for VE and Hate-speech songs stocked in high-risk library, it is observed that 3,350 audio cases are taken down on average monthly (Up to date)
6. Made a planner for ASR models to be launched for short video and LiveStream Business lines, replaced Google ASR services with Inhouse ASR models in Russia, Pakistan and Bangladesh.
7. Assisted in the launch of audio-Gandalf model in US and RU, with US enqueue volume will be decreased by 60%, violation rate will be increased by 140%.



#### Embedding Visual models in Video moderation pipeline 

1. Analyzing typical characteristics and providing solutions for common features of badcases feedback by Issue PNP; ( with GPIOs)
2. Raised Animated Model training request to productize Visual models for moderation (with AI-Lab Singapore-Computer vision Team Logan Zuo) 
3. Identify loopholes in moderation pipeline, applied Machine-learning-powered productization on TikTok Short Video Business Lines via building Eating Disorder models and the regular iteration of visual models. 
4. Offered Immediate response to US Safety team by localized iteration of weapon model for dealing with the 3D-printed guns and bullets issues. (With Logan Zuo)
5. Coordinating with Video Level Model Compliance review and model precision/recall evaluation 

#### Knowledge Management and Skills Transfer 

1. 【Oversee various issue verticals, product lines, and ML processes】Established a comprehensive workflow for more efficient communication and cooperation with Issue PNP/policy, Feature policy and established a daily request  process for Model PNP;
2. 【Mentorship for new onboarders】Familiarize new fellows with ByteDance Feature-PNP domain knowledge.That includes machine learning concepts, basic AI concepts, and data science fundamentals. Help them to gain more understanding to evaluate data, ask the right questions about said data, and more.
