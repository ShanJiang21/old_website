<blockquote>
  <p>O my eternal soul,
Hold fast to desire
In spite of the night
And the day on fire.
…
And Spring brought me the frightening laugh of the idiot.

<p>Massive blaze encompasses the Notre Dame Cathedral, which is not only a landmark of Paris,  also an icon of Europe.</p>

<p>Shock and quietness engulf all the people, real fears spread among the public, media delineate this event as a devastating disaster.</p>

<p>Roof has collapsed on such a so-called historical day, isn’t it ironic? you may able to call it an absolute tragedy for these families who have overseen the rise and falls besides the once-romantic Seine bank in Paris.</p>

<p>The grief, or you can called it the sense of feeling lost your beloved stuff, friends, appeared again for millions of parisians.</p>

<p>If you watch closely to everyone’s life, you will find there will always be certain degree of shades. There is no doubt, some of us are the lucky dogs among all creatures of God, fortune or wealth, good education or luxury commodities, it always seems to be easy and convenient. However, for those diagnosed with rare disease, are they doomed to suffer from the date of birth? I am completely discouraged by the world, and still I am a person trying to enjoy all the privilege brought to me by my family, abuse resources I have available with me.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>No hope forever,  No <em>orietur</em>.
Science and patience,
The torment is sure.</p>

<p>If the pursuit of knowledge per se cannot change the situation, what should I insist? It is almost impossible for one to keep up with the latest information every moment, it’s often exhausting and tiring, sometimes disapointing, but there is also miracle that exists always.</p>

<p>To the darkest days, tears and down hours, these will in the final be faded away.</p>

<p>There are limited time allocated for families, science and society. No wonder, why after carrying on the responsibiity to maintain the role of breadwinner in family, more care and attention are paid for the internal mechanism of the tiny cell’s interest instead of the stars on the beautify sky, not necessarily cosmology, but one more important mission for one him/herself.</p>

<p>The Platonic instinct to <strong>seek a higher principle</strong> is rooted in my mind, perhaps that is the reason why I can accept my normal good-looking and just above C+ dressing style, as for me, now the <strong>beauty as capital</strong> still cannot be prioritized.</p>

<p>I am I, unique and should be cherished, not being able to fulfill eternity, just live in the moment.</p>
