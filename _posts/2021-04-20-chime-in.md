> 'All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given to us.' – *Gandalf* the Grey.

Growing up in a peri-urban area, I witnessed some of the fabulous changes that could happen to a small town.







It's okay not to be okay sometimes and generally we are not that cool like what others are viewing us. It is not only due to that we pretend to play the role that the society presumes us to be, for which we encounters severe role conflicts, but also we found ourselves





The big moment has finally arrived. After an 8-week performance evaluation, several familiar faces will be gone from the 19th floor where my professional journey embarks. One is a data analyst leader, named Biao, whose hometown is near mine, only 1.5 hrs' drive from where I grew up. He is easygoing and has taught me many things on business. Even after I was told that he is going to leave soon, he is the one who offered to navigate my future career path in this fast-growing organization. Nothing more can express my gratitude towards him, cause after a one-year exercise in this giant tech company, my own perceptions towards the social media itself and the Internet institutions have shifted a lot. In spite of it, I am also being pushed to make decisions on where to settle down in the next few years, which is contrary to what I was firmly hold on to.

In India, Crematoriums are running days and nights to handle the skyrocketing number of death cases. Oxygen supplies are running extremely low, the desperate calls for the medical necessities are happening again by the Ganges river. Despite the heartbreaking facts, Hindu **pilgrims** (literally one who has come from afa on a journey to a holy place) are flocking to bathe in the water amid the coronovirus spikes.

Speaking of the size, this is one of the largest gatherings happening around the globe, almost 3 million people attended the long-established Kumbh Mela festival, making it a super spreader event.

Usually, I've found myself being equivocal on making decisions.

social and class inequality has always been a heated topic in public discussion.

The migration saga of *Nomadland* does prove its symbolic meaning and value for documenting and navigating us how these elderly people are living in RVs to wander on the road trip to find themselves.

Acclimatization always happens at the early days when you first arrive at somewhere new. Migration of youngsters in the new era is no longer a legend any more, individuals who own enough talent the bravery to choose

I cannot imagine how my personal/social roles can be evolved, but it definitely requires endless efforts and practice.

I am right just besides you.
