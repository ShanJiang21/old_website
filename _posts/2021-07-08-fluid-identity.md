经常会有人网上蹦迪，网下社死。实际上是一个实体，多个自我被安排在多个不同的场景之中的体现。

媒介是人的延伸，也是人的切割，技术其实本身会放大这些我们在日常生活中所遇到的问题。

Using WeChat is like being dragged into `an always-on Lifestyle`.

Just go with the flow, nice and zen.

Fate Accompli.

> 你待过的城市
> 都会成为你性格的一部分
> 就好像你爱过的恋人
> 都会成为你性格的一部分 -- 罗智成

真的是特殊的一天，反正不管如何都决定了要走出了这一步，转换空间，也带不回来已经流逝的时间。

Anyway, 又换一个城市，又换一种心境。八月之前还有一个多月的时间好好看看这个城市，之后还要一直来北京出差，似乎过渡期也就还好，没那么感伤和情绪化了。

真的是像候鸟一样，大学毕业之后，平均一年搬一次家，这可能就是我年轻人身份的体现吧～

这次，不知道是不是倦鸟归巢呢？

今天同事分享了她的新观察：不论是主产品部门，还是TNS，TikTok的每个人都面临着严重的`Identity Crisis`, I couldn't agree more. Fluid indentify brings serious issues & concerns.

今天凌晨听了个非常cool的讲座，Columbia Global center组织了四人对谈，讲关于对于love的认知。作为old-school的互联网从业者，不喜欢date app，

可能还是期待love找上我，不希望我去追寻所谓的恋爱关系，真的是想多了呢……LOL

But, why people are only celebrating for the ***romantic love***?

Modern love and marriage have become the thing that being used to unite all the people.

I think to pursue the one is like a fantasy, and it may lead to the disappointment. Here is an enormous difference: we are dating mostly strangers now, we used to date friends/people in the security networks that are close to us.

When you are just getting a piece of someone, you fantasizing about the person and that falling into love will just lead into disappointment.

We are bad at predicting our love or what we want.

> Thanks for sharing, I want to ask for a girl in her 20s, and she had never fallen into love for anybody, there is kind of shame/pressure being put for her, what should she do?

> I found this song by mistake, but it was the best mistake I have ever made.

Recently, I checked an old friend's blog, and it shall be saved for future use: (a trip to Hawaii).

`Loco moco` is a good must-try.

> Early in his Presidency, Joe Biden set the Fourth of July as a deadline, both for seventy per cent of Americans to receive one shot of the vaccine and, more broadly, for a return to normalcy.
>
> This sounds like an interaction of the normal occupational setting and salary man. Setting up the OKRs and fulfill the milestones. However, this should be achievable and a qualified worker should also consider the risks if the goals are not met.

It's again, another season of graduation for my previous college fellow classmates. This month, marks the centennial of the CPC. Propoganda materials are flying around, the State Media, along with the

I want him/her to hear different voices and tones.

 **Live minimally and “think and express freely.”**

Young people are chilling, and Beijing is not happy about it. Both the economist and New York Times journalists are setting some space for reporting this unique lifestyle among Chinese youngsters.  

> [“Lying Flat Is Justice,”](https://gnews.org/zh-hant/1275088/)  was was being celebrated by Chinese millennials as an anti-consumerist manifesto.

“Lying flat” went viral and has since become a broader statement about Chinese society. Endless stress from social norms has pushed them to their limit. The "Lying flat" lifestyle delineates some basic standards: forgo marriage, [not have children](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/01/world/asia/china-vasectomies.html), stay unemployed and **eschew material wants** such as a house or a car. This seems to be a betray of the traditional work ethic and a backlash against China’s [hypercompetitive work environment](https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/12/world/asia/12beijing.html).

上一代中国人(或者说80后前的长辈们)的主流成功哲学为：辛勤工作，立业成家，子孙满堂。而如今，a growing share is giving up on marriage.

I have decided to carry out an experiment: stay away from Wechat Moments and this will continue for 28 days as the phase I, and I would write down some personal reflections after it in early August.

**Never be afraid of conflicts**

> Today's headline: Didi, which is the largest ride-hailing service provider in China, was just taken down from the APP market, and it seems it will fall into deeper troubles as regulators are paying increasing attention to it.

不要让你的内心充满恐惧。

纽约的一个雨天，我期待太高，可惜甜茶也救不了这个片子，看到30min过就睡着了。

A one and a Two.

看完了《一一》，被洋洋的最后独白吸引住了。

也让我莫名想到人生的开端和结尾，从一个婚礼走到一个葬礼。

后脑勺我们是看不到的，一般也没有动机去看。正因为你看不到背面，你看不到生活的另外一面。所以，杨德昌才要拍给我们看，是吧。

> 因为你奔跑的太快，因为你看不到生活中所有琐碎的一面.

一一，一天接着一天，一代接着一代，一人看着一人，竟看到了自己。

在我家，也把外婆叫做婆婆，而舅舅，现在就和剧中的婆婆一样，从我大学毕业的那个6月到现在，已经躺了3年多的时间，第一次听到这个故事的时候，被这惊人的巧合震惊到了，但今天当我再慢下脚步，驻足聆听杨德昌想要讲给我听的故事的时候，似乎又看到了悲哀的我自己。

> 做的都是自己不喜欢的事，怎么会开心呢？

每个人在新的一天开始的时候都不会害怕，所以我们害怕的只是新的一天遇到的未知/不确定/可能的难题，但正是这不确定性和偶然力改变了一成不变的既定生活轨道，就像洋洋上的那堂地理公开课上所讲的：一切生命的线索，都源于四亿年前的那道偶然闪电。

小娟的声音是清澈的，山谷里的居民也是可爱的。

从初中二年级第一次听到她们的歌，到如今的11年后，坐在保利剧院现场，听着小娟的声音如溪水潺潺，他们的力量似乎也涌进了我心里。

经常听见有人说 we owe it all to the hippies，确实，好的音乐可以和灵魂共鸣。

一个小小愿望：以后我结婚的时候（如果有这么一天），一定要在现场放**红布绿花朵**。

在暴雨天，没有WFH，依旧选择去办公室的原因是：家里的网速再叠加VPN，真的可以急死我。
Anyway，北京的雨季要来了，干燥炎热要被潮湿的天气赶跑咯。
