My data analyst was questioning me for the North Star metrics that they can provide for model training, which made me reckon the past motives and feasibility check I did for this seemingly-magnificent project.

我的go短链接申请被拒绝了。

理由如下：是名字缩写的话，建议用全拼。js很容易跟JavaScript搞混淆。

就该说什么呢？取名需谨慎，哈哈哈哈哈。

Today I picked up a new word to describe myself, sometimes I am indeed a `fritterer`, as I would choose to spend my time/money/energey on something wasteful, lol.  

> once you've "*frittered* it away," you can't get it back!

外在状态会改变内在。有的时候，做一个好的listener非常重要。

今天听到一个播客，其中有一个比喻，如果一个人不慎掉入井下，有共情能力的人，会做的一件事是：去井下，一起陪伴；而有同情心的人：是在井边，提供解决方法。

安慰别人的时候，需要留一点时间给别人，让对方感觉到陪伴。

当一个人在倾诉的时候，不要把话题抢过来，让他们成为话题的中心者。

**Pitfalls:** `没关系` 的缩小化, 其实不太适合安慰同辈。

In tennis, love is **a word that represents a score of zero**, and has been used as such since the late 1800s. There are two origins writing from Merriam Webster for reference:

- One is that the word derived from French *l'œuf*. (False Theory)
- Another, and far more accepted, is that this sense of *love* comes from the expression "to play for love." A similar idea is found in the origin of the word *[amateur](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/amateur)*, which can refer to a person who does something strictly for love; the word comes from the Latin word *amare*, meaning "to love."

今天才知道余英时先生8.1在New Jersey逝世了，`Academia Sinica`和港中文都在五号发出悼文，周保松的一席话也看得我感慨万分。

> *我完全同意先生信中一段话：**“**但愿我们有足够的勇气和智慧，继续作一点事。**”**即以此语互相勉励吧。*

I just need some time to digest it and find a way out.
