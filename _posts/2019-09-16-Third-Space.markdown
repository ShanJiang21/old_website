From a young 6-year-old little girl to a 23-year-old adult woman, what and where has helped/benefitted me most? 

I try to ask myself, the inclusive sets certainly my *family*, *school*, and the temporal phase in *professional occasions*.

I still rememeber the noisy farmer's market where I grew when I was young. As a veteran, my dad did what he can to best utilize the stipend he received when he retired from the army. He started a grocery store with my mom, operating from 4:00 am to 6:00 pm every day, except for the Spring Festival. Namely, they work almost 360 days each year for about 18 years until last year after I graduated from college. 

He failed to get in the local SOE when he was about 35 years old, while that implies the door for uplifting for him.

>  All his notes were in happy mode.

These who are close to him are even more surprised than the fans. 

I hate the labelling, it attaches atigma, ignores the heterogenity of the individual and often is the source of bias.

Just as the headlines indicated: Cafes, Coffee Shops, Bookstores, Bars, Hair Salons, and Other Hangouts at the Heart of a Community. 

Though home and workplace have been two places which take the dominant role in our daily life.

*Farmers' Market*

Every Tuesday there are tons of vegetables, bread and groceries freshly on sale in front of the Hammer library which is just the third space
