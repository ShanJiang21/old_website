You made my day.

> 认识世界，克服困难。洞悉所有，贴近生活。寻找真爱，感受彼此。这就是生活的意义。
> You've said it and I couldn't agree more: "Freedom ain't free."

同事分享了她在冰岛雷克雅未克租车环岛的奇幻旅程，也勾起了我要去冰岛的愿望，不得不说，这部片子更像是一部风光片，去玩滑板，去骑行，去hiking，我觉得看完这部电影，其实真正传达的是一种在生活中认清真相之后依旧热爱，依旧stride for pride的勇气。

中国公司出海/国际化，难免会面临本土化的问题。

这也就证明了为什么在我们的产品部门为什么还会存在policy部门这样一种存在。

这就像以前在学校中常常听到的「中国社会学本土化」这样的问题一样，总有不同学派的scholar为此笔墨官司争执不停。但是在中国本土化过程中，新劳工群体，劳工意识与文化似乎都没有很系统性的研究（也正常，毕竟之前出海的中国企业/品牌也很少)。

*阴阳打工人*:
指的是一些就职于中国的出海公司，致力于国际化业务，因为项目复杂多变，对接全球各大时区的POC，且必须第一时间做出应急处理的打工人，因其开会时间多在深夜/清晨，或由深夜开到清晨，故称之为阴阳打工人。

#### 2021-06-09: How urgent is your work?

Few teams have a 12 hour on-call cycle where one person is online for 12 hours while the other person who is located in a different timezone sleeps peacefully.

Recently, I watched a new TV series called `9-1-1`, which sort of echos my current job content. Instead of just enjoying the trailer, I chose to binge watch several episodes while enjoying a young coconut treat (sweet yet refreshing).

On-call scheduling, sometimes referred to as on-call shifts are processes used in business where employee work schedules are intentionally unpredictable.

You need to take care of all the operational issues/bugs/tickets while you are on-call.

Late night/early morning calls suck as the system are trapping me and treating me like a phone.  

Escaping from the disclosure from the public does not mean that the real-life emergencies are solved or can be healed at the moment, thus we do need an extra layer of

I don’t think I have the bandwidth to cover all piles of projects and still have a good coach on my potential supervisors.

Fairytale-like answers are just an illusion.

> That there's some good in this world, Mr. Frodo. And it's worth fighting for.

On a personal level, I feel great if I am being acknowledged. However, it is usually awkward for me to respond to such appreciation or compliments upon the moment.

Never settle for a single place until you find the place you are passionate about.

* **偏见**：看Minari这样深刻，但会令我痛苦两周的文艺片 要比看甜甜的，但给我带来满足和开心的韩剧高尚；
* 目前我所经历的阵痛，很可能和自己非常有限的生活阅历和情绪反应正相关：
  * 一种近乎于洁癖式的清高: 理想
  * 内心预判的鄙视链: 看纪录片真的就比看沙雕综艺高尚吗？
  * 对于guilty pleasure的抵抗：但是世界上是有纯粹的快乐的，明明已经被工作每天按在地上摩擦，为什么不放过自己，喝一杯让自己开心的奶茶？

性格的中性不应该成为职场上的blocker，仅有的女性性格优势应该助力我们，成为我们职业发展中的助推器。

Don't be too harsh on yourself.

Guilty Pleasure: 垃圾小说/破电视剧/anything可以帮助自己撑下来，都没有关系。

### 无差别枪击与精神疾病

> serious mental illness was present in only 11% of all mass murderers and in only 8% of mass shooters.

Mass shooting is also an epidemic.
和公众常识认知差异比较大，在所有的无差别杀人案的凶手中，患有严重精神疾病仅占有11%，而在无差别枪击的凶手中，患有严重精神疾病的更只占到8%左右。目前TikTok每日的视频发文量级，大概在1亿左右，而随手一查，一天就是325,344条 mass shooting 的结果，不得不让人心惊。

It's okay not to be okay sometimes and generally we are not that cool like what others are viewing us. It is not only due to that we pretend to play the role that the society presumes us to be, for which we encounters severe role conflicts, but also we found ourselves are lacking the required adaptability.
