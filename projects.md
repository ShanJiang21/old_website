### Previous projects

Below is an incomplete list of projects I have worked on.


#### 1. NLP: Data science jobs outlook

[Data science jobs outlook-based on text mining analysis](https://shanjiang21.github.io/P8105_final_website.io/)

Two datasets were adopted for our data science job analysis.

Data Scientist Job Posts in the U.S on Indeed Website in 2018 August. This Indeed dataset originates from Indeed website, containing 7,000 data scientist jobs around the U.S. by August 3rd, 2018. Main variables include Company Name, Position Name,  Location, Job Description, and Number of Reviews of the Company. We mainly squared at the job description column that contains information such as a short description of company and position, requirement and route of application.

Based on the ranking of total revenues of each company’s retrospective fiscal year, Fortune magazine’s annual report of top 500 largest companies in the U.S has always been regarded as a reliable measurement for the value of a company. Many of the Fortune 500 companies now have a job title of Chief Data Scientist or Head of Analytics, and some Internet magnets have invested much on data mining, Artificial Intelligence or related areas.

Comparison of top-500 companies and non-top 500 companies are based on Data from The 500 Largest Industrial Corporations in the U.S., Published by Fortune magazine (updated by October 5, 2018)
Given that differences of preference of these big-names and small companies may have for employees, we will combine the Fortune 500 company list and our Indeed dataset by company name. Through creating a new logical variable named flag to indicate whether each company falls into Fortune 500 companies category or not, this full dataset will be adopted for our Exploratory analysis.


#### 2. Social Network Analysis

I've started doing computational social network analysis for a while, recently I helped with one project on the flow of officials from different positions in China with policy reform.

#### 3. Bangladesh Migrants Study

The project is aiming at evaluate the living conditions of Bangladesh Domestic Migrants.

Several findings have beyond my expectation:

* The minor marriage happens for more than half of the girls before 18 years old.
* 22% girls needs to get their marriage before 15 years old.
* The work-abuse are mainly focus on the verbal abuse.
