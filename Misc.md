### Footprints

I was Born in Anhui, China(30.6392° N, 117.8474° E).
<br>
Once Studied in New York City, NY(40.7128° N, 74.0060° W).
<br>
Now Lives & works in Beijing, China(39.9042° N, 116.4074° E).

Computation and experiment design capabilities are two major components I acquired along the way studying biostatistics, and I believe they are the fundamental elements for research in this digital-era.

Meanwhile my past field experience and training in sociology also push me to gain more insights into the historical and institutionalized context of social issues, I really enjoy such kind of logical analysis, which are uttered with good story telling skills or videos, and they are just like the travel experience I have had. The more cities I have been to, the more I have met and seen, the the more likely I am able to find the one I love most.

> In his first year as an assistant professor, Jay had ten papers and three grants rejected, and zero publications. His son and daughter were born in his first two years as a faculty member and ensured that he maintained the appearance and intellectual capacity of a zombie until he went up for tenure.

Beside, I think the capability to accept that not everything you want to do in your life will go straight to you after your endless effort. To appreciate the imprefectness and the missed parts, it demands the mindset of not pushing things or behaviors to extremes and care less about something you messed up instead of focusing on the mistakes. The harsh life experience for Prof. Bavel inspired my reflections and I hope you can find some power in these unofficial but thought-provoking [bio](http://www.psych.nyu.edu/vanbavel/lab/lab-members.html).
